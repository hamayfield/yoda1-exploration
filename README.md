# A comparison of Yoda1-treated osteocyte RNA sequencing data to the osteocyte transcriptome (Youlten et al, 2021), osteocyte mechanosome (Gilbert et al, 2024), Li et al's 2019 fluid shear stress dataset, and Kuttapitiya et al's 2018 BML dataset

### The Yoda1 RNAseq dataset is Control.DMSO_Yoda1_1.csv.
